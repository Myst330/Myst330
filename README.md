# Hello There!
## About me
My name is Genesis, and you may know me as Myst330.
I've been trying to learn a few languages, but I'm not quite there yet. These languages include Java, C, and Lua for Roblox.
Most of these attempts have 3am energy, meaning I get burnt out really fast. My point is that I don't have any commitment and so therefore I'm really bad.
