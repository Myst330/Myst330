<h1> Extras </h1>

<p> I like playing Minecraft and Roblox. </p>
<p> I am actually a very tiny developer in Roblox, at the moment. </p>
<p> As for school stuff, I do play the violin and I have learned a bit of tennis. </p>
<p> And for coding, I've learnt the basics of html, css, python, and a tad bit of c++ </p>
